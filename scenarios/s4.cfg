But the Queen needed soldiers who were alien to the ideas of the rebels, and she saw the dozens of plundered villages as a fair price to pay for future years of peace and prosperity."

Their chances of victory diminished with each new orc gang that arrived. At the same time, the western provinces, particularly Elensefar, did not seem to realise the importance of what was happening and were in no hurry to send help."
