            story=_"The first battle in Asheviere's service boded well for Bazur's gang: not only had the orcs looted the city in the course of the assault, but they had also received a reward comparable to what the High Chief had recently paid them. That's why they were so eager to take on the next task."

            story=_"Isolde, the appointed attendant, was a widow of a knight killed in the war with the orcs. Her estate was supposed to go to her husband's relatives, but new Asheviere's law, extended to nobility, allowed Isolde to take up the sword and assert her claim to knighthood. She served the Queen with zeal and was no stranger to taking on tasks not comparable to her combat experience."
