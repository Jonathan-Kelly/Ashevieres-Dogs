That's why they were so eager to take on the next task."

Her estate was supposed to go to her husband's relatives, but new Asheviere's law, extended to nobility, allowed Isolde to take up the sword and assert her claim to knighthood. She served the Queen with zeal and was no stranger to taking on tasks not comparable to her combat experience."
