By fighting them, the rebels risked losing their entire army, for orcs give no mercy and know no fatigue in pursuit. In shame, the rebel generals led the soldiers back to Dan-Tonk."

The rebels negotiated with Aethenwood and Elensefar, hoping to draw their neighbours into the war and hold out until their armies arrived. However, Asheviere learnt from the mistakes of others and immediately moved her armies on Dan-Tonk. According to her plan, the main part of the royal army was to approach the city from the south, while another unit, consisting mostly of orcs, was to capture Tath and strike from the north."
