            story=_"501 YW. Prince Eldred treacherously murdered Garard II and became King of Wesnoth, but his reign came to an abrupt end at the hands of Delfador at the Battle of Tath. Only the king's minor nephews, his three-year-old daughter Li'Sar, and Queen Consort Asheviere remained alive from the royal family."

        [part]
            story=_"The status of Queen consort deprived Asheviere of her rights to the throne. She would have been satisfied with the role of Regent to the young Li'Sar, but there was a catch: according to the old tradition, women had no inheritance rights, which meant that one of Garard's nephews would be king. Each of them was supported by noble lords who would undoubtedly take advantage of the situation and push Asheviere and her daughter into the background."

        [part]
            story=_"Asheviere didn't want to live in someone else's shadow. She saw herself as the rightful Queen of Wesnoth, and her daughter as the heiress. So she started to act."

        [part]
            story=_"After killing all of the minor nephews, Asheviere used her regent status and made a law equalizing men and women in the right of inheritance. Technically, this did not remove her status as Consort Queen, and the throne should have passed to Li'Sar. However, Asheviere declared that she would rule as Queen until the princess became an adult."

        [part]
            story=_"Some of the noble lords, mostly from Eldred's army, swore allegiance to the new Queen. The other part, from the veterans of Garard, openly opposed it. They decided that if Wesnoth needed a new king, he should be chosen among them, the most worthy lords, not among the powerless, deceitful remnants of the royal family."
